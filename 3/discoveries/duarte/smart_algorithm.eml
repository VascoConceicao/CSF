Dear Mr. President Eurico Trocos,

Thank you for your guidance. I have noted the updates for the smart 
algorithm and will ensure it handles the highlighted plates with the 
care and efficiency you expect.
Should you wish to provide additional plates for special handling, I am 
ready to integrate them seamlessly.

As my inbox is quite full, I might miss follow-ups in this thread. For 
quicker responses, we can continue via WhatsApp.

Best regards,
Duarte Calado
Head of MEMEL System Engineer
