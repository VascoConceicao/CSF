01:05 < johhnymusk> Hey Cat, how've you been doing? 
01:05 < CatDucky> Hii João, I'm great, Poland has been treating me well! This comp is killing me tho ahahah
01:06 < johhnymusk> Oh right you're on a CTF comp! Must be nice to be smart.
01:06 < CatDucky> Oh don't be mean to yourself, what about all those cool tricks I taught you?
01:06 < johhnymusk> Yeah right, if it wasn't for my broken leg, I'd be there in Poland with you...
01:06 < CatDucky> What! You broke your leg??
01:07 < johhnymusk> Yeah, I was biking on one of those ZYRA bikes when all of a sudden it just started speeding up and I couldn't hit the breaks! I tried to sue them but nothing came of it... I'll show them
01:07 < CatDucky> What are you planning johnny?
01:07 < johhnymusk> I will steal their client's credentials and get free credits for me! MUAHAHAH
01:08 < CatDucky> That... is very much illegal, I know I taught you some stuff but please don't use it for harm.
01:08 < johhnymusk> Ah, don't worry, they'll never catch me.
01:08 < CatDucky> Sure, I'll believe that. How are you planning on doing that anyways?
01:08 < johhnymusk> You know how I'm doing my thesis with professor Nuno right? They got this machine at Syssec that I can use to host a phishing website, no one will know it was me.
01:09 < CatDucky> Again João, be very careful, that is *illegal*, I don't want nothing bad to happen to you, and because of such a petty thing.
01:09 < johhnymusk> Don't worry, about me Cat, I'll show you how good I am! Speaking of which, what are you planning on doing the day you arrive from Poland? *smirk*
01:09 < CatDucky> Don't even start it, MuskyBoi...

01:21 < johhnymusk> Yoyo Cat,  Look I just got an e-mail from you... what's that about?
01:22 < CatDucky> I don't have much time right now, but I got that e-mail... and uh... I think you might be able to need those files
01:22 < johhnymusk> I thought you said that what I was doing was illegal.
01:22 < CatDucky> And it is! Be careful
01:22 < johhnymusk> Why are you helping me out right now?
01:23 < CatDucky> Well, as I said I don't have much time to look into those myself, since I'm in the comp right now, and I know deep down that you're doing this cause you want to make what's right!
01:23 < johhnymusk> Yeah I do, I'm glad you understand, I'm still just a little confused with all of this.
01:23 < CatDucky> We'll talk more when I get back home
01:23 < johhnymusk> Wait what?

01:42 < johhnymusk> Cat, I understand now, private messages among people who don't want to pay parking; Reports that takl AI calibration; A piece of code clearly stating preferential plates; And a database that confirms that some plates are not even paying parking! And a LOT of money involveed! MEMEL is rigging the system in their favor! And this "Futuro Inteligente" is also behind this.
01:43 < CatDucky> What, really? That is very dangerous, we don't know who we are up against Johnny... Don't do anything illegal please.
01:43 < johhnymusk> Don't worry Cat, I won't get caught, I just have to hide these files somehow...
01:44 < CatDucky> I heard about a good github repo for this, I think the github name was something like shadowexploit, look for FileHider or HideFiles something like this.
01:44 < johhnymusk> RIGHT! You're the best CAT!

02:04 < johhnymusk> Cat Cat, All is ready!
02:04 < CatDucky> Johnny, please be very careful, you can go to jail for this...
02:05 < johhnymusk> Don't you worry, everything is secured and deployed, ZYRA is gonna suffer now.
02:05 < CatDucky> Don't forget to delete all of the files off of your machine, use a command called SRM.
02:05 < johhnymusk> Got it! Thank u.
